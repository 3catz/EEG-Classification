# EEG-Classification
This project was a joint effort with the neurology labs at UNL and UCD Anschutz to use deep learning to classify EEG data.

This is currently a work in progress. The goal is to use a combined CNN-RNN architecture to perserve both spaical and time information in th classification of EEG data. This work builds on the following publication:
